    <p>What is boba made of? How is it made? Read to find out!</p>
    <p>Boba is mainly made of Topioca starch. Once the Topioca starch is made into dough, it is shaped into little pearls which are then dried and boiled. These boba pearls can be added into a variety of styles such as normal bubble tea or in smoothies. It's a delicious drink to have, and you can make it at home too!</p>
